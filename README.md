### The player's task is to build his village, which will extract resources, on a limited area of terrain. To win, you need to build an administration, since it is this building that will make your village a city, which means the game will end.

### To build an administration in the game there are different buildings that extract resources. In addition, there are special buildings in the game that will help to achieve greater efficiency of your resource-producing buildings. It is worth considering that the buildings do not work around the clock, so these buildings are extremely important, because they can increase the daily working time from 16 to 22 hours!
